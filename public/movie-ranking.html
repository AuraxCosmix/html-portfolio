    <h1>The Best Animes According to Nikki</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Blue Lock - BL</h3>
<p>Because the characters make me interested (only Sae Itoshi and Michael Kaiser.) and football looks so cool (even though it doesn't look like football because all they have is egoists that has aura around them, and that Shidou Ryusei is so freaky he even has BIG BANG DRIVE).</p>

<h3>Haikyu!!</h3>
<p>Because volleyball is amazing, specially now that volleyball is my top two favorite sport. And Tsukishima Kei is my top 1 reason why I watched volleyball lol.</p>

<h3>Obey Me!</h3>
<p>This is a really underrated anime, they also have two games about that. And yes Macy, I know you used to like one of those dudes from there.</p>
